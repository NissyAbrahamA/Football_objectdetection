Object detection with YOLOv8 model
This project presents a football object detection system utilizing the YOLOv8 model, designed for accuracy and efficiency.

The system leverages a custom dataset sourced from the Open Images Dataset, providing a robust foundation for detection tasks. Please refer to Open Images website to acquire the downloader and the train, val test dataset configuration.
The 'dataset_creation' directory houses essential scripts for dataset curation and organization, ensuring compatibility with YOLOv8 requirements.
For model training, the 'train.py' script is provided, enabling fine-tuning of the YOLOv8 model on the custom football dataset. 
Additionally, the 'predict.py' script offers a means to evaluate the model's performance
